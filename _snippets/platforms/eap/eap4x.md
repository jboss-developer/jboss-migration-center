Server Configuration
--------------------

JMS
: HornetQ, is the new ultra high performance enterprise grade messaging system in JBoss EAP 6.  It replaces JBossMQ in JBoss EAP 4.2.0 and JBoss Messaging in JBoss EAP 4.2.1. The server configuration attributes for HornetQ are different from both JBossMQ and JBoss Messaging.  Section [2.5 of the HornetQ User Guide](https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/5/html-single/HornetQ_User_Guide/index.html#idm56911320) defines the relationship between the new and old attributes.
